= Evalution

After creating the new instance, test the connectivity by attempting ICMP ping and SSH access to the instance. 

[source, bash]
----
ping -c 1 IP
----

[source, bash]
----
ssh -i /home/student/osp_training/.scenariobfx020/scenario-bfx020-key.pem cirros@IP cat /etc/cirros/version
----

**Replace IP with appropriate string in both the above commands.**

.Sample output

== Evaluation

As the student user on the workstation vm, use the lab command to grade your work.

[source, bash]
----
cd ~/osp_training/scenarios_repo/
./lab grade bfx020

====
Provide the gocubsgo as a password if prompted by the grade action.
====

== Finish

Run the lab finish command to complete this exercise. This step is important to ensure that resources from current exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.

----
cd ~/osp_training/scenarios_repo/
./lab finish bfx020
----

This concludes the lab exercise.
